#  Advanced Multi-Modal Crop Health Classification System

This project implements a **sophisticated multi-modal deep learning system** in **PyTorch** for classifying crop health.  
It leverages a combination of **synthetic multi-spectral imagery, temporal sensor data, and environmental context** to achieve robust and accurate predictions.  

The model incorporates advanced architectural components like **residual blocks, attention mechanisms, and an LSTM for temporal analysis**.

## Key Features

### Multi-Modal Data Fusion  
Integrates three distinct data sources for a **holistic analysis**:

1. **Spectral Data**  
   - 5-channel imagery (**RGB, NIR, SWIR**).

2. **Temporal Sensor Data**  
   - 7-day history of sensor readings (**temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.**).

3. **Environmental Context**  
   - Static data such as **season, soil type, and elevation**.

### Advanced Model Architecture

- **ResNet-style CNN backbone** with channel & spatial attention for processing spectral images.  
- **LSTM network** to capture temporal patterns in sensor data.  
- **Cross-modal attention** to intelligently weigh the importance of each data modality for the final prediction.  
- **Uncertainty Estimation Head** to predict model confidence, helping flag low-confidence predictions for human review.

### Robust Training Pipeline

- **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance.  
- **WeightedRandomSampler** for balanced batches during training.  
- **AdamW optimizer** with **Cosine Annealing LR scheduler** for stable convergence.  
- **Advanced data augmentation** techniques for both spectral and sensor data.
